                                Our commitment to accessibility means we maintain a primarily free platform for students. We sustain our operations through several ethical revenue streams:

                Our digital advertising program carefully selects education-related advertisements that provide value to our users while maintaining clear separation between editorial content and sponsored material.

                Premium services offer additional tools and resources for students who choose enhanced features, while ensuring essential educational information remains free and accessible to all.

                Educational institutions partner with us through transparent, paid promotional opportunities that help them reach potential students while maintaining our editorial independence.
