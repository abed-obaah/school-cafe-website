                The name “SchoolCafe” carries deep cultural significance rooted in Nigeria’s internet revolution. In the Nigerian context, cyber cafes were more than just internet access points; they were educational lifelines.

                While the Western world saw cybercafés as casual spots combining internet access with refreshments, in Nigeria, they were vital educational hubs where students completed assignments, processed admissions, checked results, and accessed crucial academic information.

                These cyber cafes served as the primary gateway to educational opportunities for countless Nigerian students.

                By combining “School” with “Cafe,” we pay homage to this unique Nigerian experience. Just as cybercafés were once the central hub for all educational needs, SchoolCafe now serves as the digital equivalent, a comprehensive platform where students can access everything they need for their academic journey.

                Our name reflects our mission to provide the same universal access to educational resources but in a modern, digital format accessible from anywhere.

                Every successful journey begins with a simple step. For School Cafe, that step was taken by our founder, Victor Ijomah, during his time at Delta State University.

                    Armed with a second-class degree in mathematics and computer science, Victor witnessed firsthand the challenges students faced in accessing reliable educational information.

                    This experience, combined with his later pursuit of a Master’s in Digital Marketing from Chester University in the United Kingdom, laid the foundation for what would become Nigeria’s most comprehensive educational technology platform.
